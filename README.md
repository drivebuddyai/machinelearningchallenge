# Welcome to drivebuddyAI ML data pre-processing challenge
The goal here is to train a model that can classify whether a given image is of pavbhaji or not

NOTE :
- Json file contains metadata for instageram post is to be used for classification 
- Images are provided for the instagram post in the json_meta.

#### GIVEN :
The <i><b>data</i></b> dir consists of data that have <i><b>#pavbhaji</i></b> in their description or comment.

>     dataset.zip
>         |
>      dataset
>          |--- images
>                  |--- 1 (pavbhaji images)
>                  |--- 0 (non-pavbhaji images)
>          |--- pavbhaji.json (post meta data)

Where json file consist of entries for post and its metadata.

#### TASK:

- Analyse and generate a report for the given data and your insights for the same.
- List down features and their relevance for training a classification model.
- Train the model & predict whether the image contains the Pav-Bhaji or not.


#### Deliverable
