# Welcome to drivebuddyAI ML data pre-processing challenge
The goal here is to train a model that can classify whether a given data i.e {image , json_meta} is an image of pavbhaji or not

#####  Challenge task
The goal is to do data processing and data analysis.

#### GIVEN :
The <i><b>data</i></b> dir consists of data scraped from instagram for post that have <i><b>#pavbhaji</i></b> in their description or comment.

>     dataset.zip
>         |
>      dataset
>          |--- images
>                  |--- 0 (pavbhaji images)
>                  |--- 1 (non-pavbhaji images)
>          |--- pavbhaji.json (post meta data)

Where json file consist of entries for post and its metadata.

#### TASK:

- Analyse and generate a report for the given data and your insights for the same.
- List down features and their relevance for training a classification model.
- Get data ready for training pre-processing


#### Deliverable
Send the fallowing deliverables to HR@drivebuddyai.com:
- Source Code (.py or .ipynb)
- Data analysis report.
- What are the challenges you faced while working on the data?
- How did you overcome those and what approach you try to solve the problem?


#### Evaluation
We will evaluate you based on
  - Your Coding skill as well as familiarity with ML libraries
  - Your understanding of data and extracted features.
