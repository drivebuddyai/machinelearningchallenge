# Welcome to drivebuddyAI ML data pre-processing challenge
The goal here is to train a model that can classify whether a given instagram post meta_data i.e {image , json_meta} is an image of pavbhaji or not

##  <u><b>Instagram post classification challenge</b></u>
The goal of this challenge is to do data processing and data analysis.

NOTE :
This is a text based classification task (using json data) and <i><b>not Image classification challenge</i></b>

- Json file contains metadata for instageram post is to be used for classification 
- Images are provided for the instagram post in the json_meta.

#### GIVEN :
The <i><b>data</i></b> dir consists of data scraped from instagram for post that have <i><b>#pavbhaji</i></b> in their description or comment.

>     dataset.zip
>         |
>      dataset
>          |--- images
>                  |--- 0 (pavbhaji images)
>                  |--- 1 (non-pavbhaji images)
>          |--- pavbhaji.json (post meta data)

Where json file consist of entries for post and its metadata.

#### TASK:

- Analyse and generate a report for the given data and your insights for the same.
- List down features and their relevance for training a classification model.
- Get data ready for training pre-processing


#### Deliverable
